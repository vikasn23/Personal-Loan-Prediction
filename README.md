## Context

A US bank named Thera Bank has a sizable customer base. The majority of these clients are liability clients (depositors), and their deposits range in amount. Asset customers make up a very tiny portion of the bank's customer base, and the bank is interested in swiftly growing this group to attract more loan business and, as a result, increase its interest-earning potential. The management is particularly interested in finding ways to turn its liability customers into personal loan customers while keeping them as deposits.

To identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan is our main target.

## Motivation

To understand Logistic regression, Support Vector, Decision tree, hyperparamter tuning Decision trees and explore these algorthims using Sklearn
